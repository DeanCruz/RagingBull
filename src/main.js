// Approx 20+ hours spent on the project
// Creative tilt: Laser firing and collision & UFO random spawning
// Explanation: 
// Laser firing: This was the most technically complicated part of the program
// because I had to create an array to store the lasers in that would create a laser
// on mouse click input, I then had to adjust the collision handling to handle the laser
// destroying the UFO's without it affecting anything else
// The UFO random spawning was similarly complicated as I had to create an array that 
// kept pushing UFO's into it whenever they spawn. To detect collision it uses the array
// of UFO's for reference.
